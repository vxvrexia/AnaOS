# AnaOS
AnaOS (despite the name, is not an operating system) is a collection of tools, compacted into a fully customisable python file.

You NEED to download python from https://www.python.org/downloads/ for this to work!! 
You can just download the latest version :)

It will only work on PC 

Starting at line 131 of the code you can add URLs to the code!
eg
    webbrowser.open("url for Playlist",new=1)
    Change the part inside the speech marks for a URL (make sure you keep the speech marks!!!!)
